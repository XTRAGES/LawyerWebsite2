üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend:

CSS3 (Custom Styling)

JavaScript (for basic client-side interactions, e.g., animations)

Font Awesome (for icons)

Backend:

PHP (for server-side logic, form handling, authentication, and database interaction)

Database:

MySQL (for storing contact messages)

Server Environment:

XAMPP / WAMP / MAMP (or any Apache/PHP/MySQL stack)

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
A web server environment with PHP and MySQL installed (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or Docker with a PHP/MySQL setup).

A web browser.

A code editor (e.g., VS Code).

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/XTRAGES/LawyerWebsite2.git
cd LawyerWebsite2

Set up your web server:

Place the LawyerWebsite2 folder into your web server's document root (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).

Ensure the admin subfolder is also correctly placed within LawyerWebsite2.

Database Configuration:

Open config.php (located in the root of the project).

Ensure your database credentials match your local MySQL setup:

define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
define('DB_PASSWORD', ''); // Your MySQL password
define('DB_NAME', 'lawyer_website'); // Your chosen database name

Create the Database and Table:

Access your MySQL administration tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin via http://localhost/phpmyadmin).

Create a new database named lawyer_website (or whatever you defined in DB_NAME).

Execute the following SQL query to create the messages table:

CREATE TABLE messages (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Start your Apache and MySQL servers (if using XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP).

Usage
Navigate to http://localhost/LawyerWebsite2/index.php in your web browser to access the main website.

To access the Admin Dashboard:

Open http://localhost/LawyerWebsite2/admin/index.php.

Use the following hardcoded credentials for demonstration:

Username: admin

Password: password123

Once logged in, you can view and delete submitted messages.

Click "Logout" to end the session.

Important Security Note: For a production environment, hardcoded credentials are highly insecure. A robust user authentication system with hashed passwords and proper security practices would be required. The current setup is for demonstration purposes only.
